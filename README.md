## :dart: About

/\*\*
*This game will have to offer different options and guide the player throughout the game.
*When launching the algorithm, you must first greet the user and ask them to choose a level *of difficulty. This choice will influence the number of trials as well as the range of *possible numbers. Here are the details for the different levels:
*Very easy: Unlimited trials, 1 to 10
*Easy: 5 tries, 1 to 10
*Medium, 5 tries, 1 to 100
*Difficult, 8 tries, 1 to 500
*Very difficult, 9 tries, 1 to 1000
*Once the difficulty is chosen, the algorithm selects a number at random and asks the user *to start guessing. For each incorrect attempt, it will be necessary to indicate whether the *number sought is smaller or larger.
*If the player manages to find the correct answer, the game is over and the player is *congratulated. If he cannot find the solution within the allotted number of tries, he gets *a game over and the number sought is displayed. The user then has the option to end the *program or start a new game.
